Short intro: I'm a Software Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer. My main
interests are related to Linux, Kubernetes, C++, Rust, Go, security and reverse
engineering. Besides that I love reading sci-fi and historical novels, travel,
listen to music and do sport with friends (futsal, climbing, running and
swimming).
