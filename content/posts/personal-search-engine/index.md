<!-- TODO: Remove -->
**Outline:**

* Problem to solve: personal search engine.
* Excuse to talk about system design.
* Requirements
* How the website looks like at the moment.
* System diagram
* Component per component explanation (as short as possible).
* Optimizing cold starts (background index init).
* Discuss two possible reactions: laughable or genius. Both are wrong.
* Can I use it? Code is OSS, you can deploy it yourself. I already have a job, I
  don't want two.

  * Reference to "web scale" video.
  * Reliability is the #1 feature? It depends.
  * Better something ugly but finished then something perfectly designed but
    not working yet.
