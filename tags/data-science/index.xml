      <title>Domain resurrect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I processed a large fraction of the Internet on a single machine, trying to find
some valuable but forgotten domain names to buy (probably 25 years too late).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the story of what I found and how I did it, and &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the story of
&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I decided to try, because I don&amp;rsquo;t know myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler alert&lt;/strong&gt;: If you just want to know whether there is indeed something,
and you should scramble to scoop it up to become a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_speculation&#34;&gt;domain-flipper&lt;/a&gt;
billionaire, hold your horses: I believe there isn&amp;rsquo;t much. The following
sections are more focused on the engineering side, so if you only care about the
conclusion, skip to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/domain-resurrect/#results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Engineering a chess match against my brother</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of me trying to win a game of chess against my brother. A
single freaking game. What&amp;rsquo;s so special about it? Am I good at chess? Not at
all. Did I improve at my game in the process? Also no. Is it a story about &amp;ldquo;the
journey rather than the destination&amp;rdquo;? Not really. Did I at least have fun in
the process? Not so sure. This is the story of me trying to be unconventional
at probably the most studied game in existence and using my software
engineering background for something that probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t need it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
