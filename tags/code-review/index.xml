      <description>Introduction In February 2014 I had a very unpleasant surprise after coming back home from a weekend in Berlin. Me and my girlfriend found out our apartment upside down because of burglars. We suffered the loss not only of many of our belongings, but worse, of our safety.

There are a lot of online resources that help you to get started: the Rust book, the Rustonomicon and many blog posts and stack overflow questions. After I learned the basics I felt a bit lost though. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find enough resources for intermediate-level-Rustaceans.</description>
