      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Rust for a year and a half, and the best part of it, like many others say, has been the very helpful community. There are a lot of online resources that help you to get started: the Rust book, the Rustonomicon and many blog posts and stack overflow questions. After I learned the basics I felt a bit lost though. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find enough resources for intermediate-level-Rustaceans.</description>
