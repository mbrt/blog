      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2014 I had a very unpleasant surprise after coming back home from a
weekend in Berlin. Me and my girlfriend found out our apartment upside down
because of burglars. We suffered the loss not only of many of our belongings,
but worse, of our safety. We didn&amp;rsquo;t feel safe in our home and we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel
safe to leave it - not even for half an hour - for the fear to come back and
find somebody inside. It was with this mood that I started this project: totally
motivated to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
