      <title>Glassdb: transactional object storage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated by the gap between stateless and stateful applications in the
cloud. While I could easily spin up a stateless application as a &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo;
function in any major cloud provider and pretty much forget about it, persisting
data between requests was a game of pick two among three: cheap, strongly
consistent, portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could I solve portability and lack of transactions myself with &lt;em&gt;a single
client-side solution?&lt;/em&gt; I thought it would be possible through object storage
(e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&#34;&gt;AWS S3&lt;/a&gt;), which is strongly consistent,
ubiquitous and cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; is a design document? &lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; is it useful to have one? &lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; to
make it useful? These are the questions I&amp;rsquo;m going to address in this post. The
goal is to provide some bite sized, easy to remember guidelines. My promise to
you is that after this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll be faster and more effective in making and
reviewing designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a written version of a talk I gave at my current employer. Since it was
well received and helped a few folks, I decided to make it more available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
