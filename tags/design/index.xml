      <description>What is a design document? When is it useful to have one? How to make it useful? These are the questions I&amp;rsquo;m going to address in this post. The goal is to provide some bite sized, easy to remember guidelines. My promise to you is that after this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll be faster and more effective in making and reviewing designs.
This is a written version of a talk I gave at my current employer.</description>
